# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

In this homework we created a Web Visualization Dashboard using images from a past homework assignment, weather visualizations. 

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used. 

Individual HTML pages built were the index, comparisons, data, and 4 visualizations pages.
